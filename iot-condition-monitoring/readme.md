# IoT Condition Monitoring - Paderborn Bearing Dataset 

### Use Case

Many plants faces unplanned downtime and it assets fail over the period of time and plants should have the ability to predict the life remaining. 
With the help of data science, the first step is to build an ML tool to analyze the condition or health of machine assets.

### Paderborn Bearing Dataset

Our dataset of Interest(Paderborn Bearing Dataset) consists the following details:

1. The Dataset contains the motor currents and vibration signals with additional measurements of torque, speed, load and temperature
2. There are 26 Damaged bearing and 6 healthy bearing state in the data
3. All the data is collected in 4 different operating conditions.

### Goal

With help of Data Science techniques the aim is to analyze the condition of assets, identify features which contribute to failure and build effective ML models for RUL prediction.
